### The Game
	Project Fenrir is a traditional JRPG with combat mechanics akin to those of Fire Emblem
	and Final Fantasy Tactics. In the overworld, the player will explore areas to progress
	through the game, find objects and characters to interact with and initiate combat.
	Meanwhile, the combat will be composed of the player's party against an enemy party
	using a chess-like grid to move their units and try to defeat all enemy units on the
	grid. The game uses 2D sprites and animations to display the characters, environment,
	and information to the player.
	
### How to run:
	
Run the following commands on your machine or in a virtual environment using python3:

	-Open dist folder and run "fenrir-1.0-amd64.msi"
	-Change install location to a directory of your choice
	-Click next until install is finished
	-Open install directory and run "Project Fenrir.exe"
	
	Note: Default install directory is in AppData, we advise you change
		  it into a directory you have easy access to. (i.e., Documents)
	Note: The install does not create a folder for the files, we advise
		  that you create a folder in the directory of your choice and
		  select that folder as your install directory.
